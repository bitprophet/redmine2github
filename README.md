# Redmine => Github

This script is designed to copy Redmine tickets into a Github repository's Issues section, circa Github Issues v2 / Github API v3.

It was written for a very specific application: to port [Fabric](http://fabfile.org)'s hacked-up Redmine instance's data into Github Issues. Thus it makes a number of assumptions which may not hold true for others, which are documented in the NOTES file. It will still probably be very useful if properly tweaked.
